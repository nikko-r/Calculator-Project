# Calculator-Project
How you approached the project - how did you break it down?

At first I got confused and tried to add too many features so I decided to write some pseudo code and break it down also removing advanced features to not get destracted and have the basic functions working first.

A problem that you ran into, and how you managed to solve it

Figuring out how to put the correct checks into place to stop the calculator giving errors and breaking

If you could do the project again, what would you differently next time

I would try to add more features and spend less time trying to style the calculator and more time on the javascript

Something you are proud of from this project

Overall completing the project and managing to get basic features working
